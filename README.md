# About [SiteDorks](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks) ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Help%20wanted&color=green)

Search Google, Bing, Brave, Ecosia, Yahoo or Yandex for a search term with several websites. A [default list](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks.csv) is already provided, which contains Github, Gitlab, Surveymonkey, Trello etc etc. Currently, a default list of 590 dorkable websites is available.

By default, the following categories are on file: 

* analysis(13)
* cloud(88)
* comm(82)
* dev(70)
* docs(79)
* edu(13)
* fin(16)
* forms(15)
* orgs(57)
* other(7)
* remote(1)
* shortener(39)
* social(100)
* storage(9)

# Why use SiteDorks?
Why wouldn't you just enter dorks for several websites manually? Think of this:
* It's really easy to query different search engines.
* Dorks can be executed per 1 or more categories.
* It's easy to create different input files for different uses, for example put dozens of domains in 1 file for a pentest.
* Adding new websites to your search query can be arranged by just adding them to an input file (either a CSV with categories or just a list of sites).
* It already has a lot of dorkable websites included.
* The list with dorkable websites is updated regularly.
* Some search engines ignore too many keywords/characters in a query and with argument -count it's easy to split your dork into more queries.
* It contains generic lists for other counties such as [China](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-cn.csv), [France](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-fr.csv), [Germany](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-de.csv), [Korea](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-kr.csv), [The Netherlands](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-nl.csv) and [Russia](https://github.com/Zarcolio/sitedorks/blob/master/csv/sitedorks-ru.csv).
  * Need help here with generic lists for other countries, both with more entries in the current lists and with more lists. ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Help%20wanted&color=green)
* It contains a list of Dutch governmental agencies and educational services. With 1 command you can search domains of either the Dutch government or educational services.
  * Need help here with other lists that can be useful, for example domains of government and educational services in other countries. ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Help%20wanted&color=green)
* Because you want to help plant more trees using the search engine [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org) (Bing based).

  -h, --help            Show this help message, print categories on file (add -file to check other CSV file) and exit.
  -hh, --help2          Show the help inside a .csv file being called. Lines in the beginning of the script starting with # are displayed as help.
  -browser <browser>    Supply the browser executable to use or use the default browser.
  -cat <category>       Choose from 1 or more categories, use ',' (comma) as delimiter. Defaults to all categories.
  -cats                 Show all categories on file, use with or without -file.
  -count <count>        How many websites are searched per query. Google has a maximum length for queries.

# Examples
Small warning here: if you don't use **-cat** SiteDorks will open a lot of tabs in your browser and probably will make Google throw you a CAPTCHA. Increase waiting time with option '-wait' to decrease the chance of getting a CAPTCHA.

Want to look for "uber.com" with different sites containing all kinds of content using Google? Use the following command:
```
sitedorks -query '"uber.com"'
```
Want to look for "uber website" (with quotes and spaces in the query)? Use the following command:
```
sitedorks -query '"uber website"'
```
Want to search for communication invites with Yandex but leave site: out of the query? Just use the following command:
```
sitedorks -cat comm -site disable -engine yandex -query uber
```
And if you  want to see which categories are on file, for example:
```
sitedorks -file sitedorks.csv -cats
```

For searching in Dutch (para)medical websites, use the following command:
```
sitedorks -cat medi -file sitedorks-nl.csv -query somekeyword
```
